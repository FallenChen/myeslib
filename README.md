myeslib

It was inspired by: [Donâ€™t publish Domain Events, return them!](http://www.jayway.com/2013/06/20/dont-publish-domain-events-return-them/)

and off course, also by: [Simple CQRS example](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r)

Running the Inventory example
=============================
First of all, build it:
```
cd myeslib
mvn clean install
```
Before running it, you can optionally customize database settings on export-db-env-h2.sh: 
```
#!/bin/sh
DB_DATASOURCE_CLASS_NAME=org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
#DB_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:test;MODE=Oracle
DB_URL=jdbc:h2:file:~/myeslib-database;MODE=Oracle
DB_USER=scott
DB_PASSWORD=tiger
export DB_DATASOURCE_CLASS_NAME
export DB_URL
export DB_USER
export DB_PASSWORD
```
then export the db variables and call [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) to initialize the target database (H2):
```
source ./export-db-env-oracle.sh
cd inventory-database
mvn clean compile flyway:migrate -Dflyway.locations=db/h2
```
just in case, there is a script for Oracle too:
```
mvn clean compile flyway:migrate -Dflyway.locations=db/oracle
```
after this your database should be ready. Now:
```
cd ../inventory-jdbi
java -jar target/inventory-jdbi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 10 100 10 100 50
```
The parameters are: jettyMinThreads, jettyMaxThreads, dbPoolMinThreads, dbPoolMaxThreads and eventsQueueConsumers.
This service will receive commands as JSON on http://localhost:8080/inventory-item-command. It uses Hazelcast just as a cache. 

There is another implementation: inventory-hazelcast. Its more tied to Hazelcast since it uses a distributed map backed by a MapStore implementation (org.myeslib.util.hazelcast.HzMapStore) to store AggregateRootHistory instances. This map is configureed as write-through. It also uses a Hazelcast queue to store UnitOfWork instances.

Finally, in order to create and send commands to the above endpoint, start this in other console:
```
cd inventory-cmd-producer
java -jar target/inventory-cmd-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 100 60000 30000
```
The parameters are: datasetSize (how many aggregateRoot instances), delayBetweenDatasets (in milliseconds) and initialDelay. There are 3 kind of commands: CreateCommand, IncreaseCommand and DecreaseCommand. So if you define 100 commands like the example above, actually 300 commands will be sent with 60 seconds of delay between each command dataset and an initial delay of 30 seconds. 
Notes
=====
Your IDE must support [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/)

Your maven repository must contain [Oracle jdbc drivers](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html) - or you can simply remove references to it in pom.xml to use [http://www.h2database.com](H2 database) instead.

Disclaimer
==========
There are 2 packages within module 3rd-party with (intact) code from :

[mm4j - Simple multi-methods for Java](http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/jop/mm4j)

[google-gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson) Since I did not found RuntimeTypeAdapter classes within gson-2.2.4.jar
