It was inspired by: [Donâ€™t publish Domain Events, return them!](http://www.jayway.com/2013/06/20/dont-publish-domain-events-return-them/)

and off course, also by: [Simple CQRS example](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r)

Whats really matters
====================
* <a href="inventory-aggregate-root/src/main/java/org/myeslib/example/SampleDomain.java">The Inventory Item AggregateRoot</a>

Running the Inventory example
=============================
First of all, build it:
```
cd myeslib
mvn clean install
```
Before running it, you can optionally customize database settings on export-db-env-h2.sh: 
```
#!/bin/sh
DB_DATASOURCE_CLASS_NAME=org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
#DB_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:test;MODE=Oracle
DB_URL=jdbc:h2:file:~/myeslib-database;MODE=Oracle
DB_USER=scott
DB_PASSWORD=tiger
export DB_DATASOURCE_CLASS_NAME
export DB_URL
export DB_USER
export DB_PASSWORD
```
then export the db variables and call [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) to initialize the target database (H2):
```
source ./export-db-env-oracle.sh
cd inventory-database
mvn clean compile flyway:migrate -Dflyway.locations=db/h2
```
just in case, there is a script for Oracle too:
```
mvn clean compile flyway:migrate -Dflyway.locations=db/oracle
```
after this your database should be ready. Now:
```
cd ../inventory-jdbi
java -jar target/inventory-jdbi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 10 100 10 100 50
```
The parameters are: jettyMinThreads, jettyMaxThreads, dbPoolMinThreads, dbPoolMaxThreads and eventsQueueConsumers.
This service will receive commands as JSON on http://localhost:8080/inventory-item-command. It uses Hazelcast just as a cache. 

There is another implementation: inventory-hazelcast. It is more tied to Hazelcast since beside caching for snapshots, it uses a distributed map backed by a MapStore implementation to store AggregateRootHistory instances. This map is configureed as write-through. It also uses a Hazelcast queue to store UnitOfWork instances.

Finally, in order to create and send commands to the above endpoint, start this in other console:
```
cd inventory-cmd-producer
java -jar target/inventory-cmd-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 100 60000 30000
```
The parameters are: datasetSize (how many aggregateRoot instances), delayBetweenDatasets (in milliseconds) and initialDelay. There are 3 datasets. Each dataset will send just one type of command: CreateCommand, IncreaseCommand or DecreaseCommand. So the idea is to send comands in this order correct order (create, increase and decrease), while having a delay between each dataset in order to avoid ConcurrentModificationExceptions. 
Notes
=====
* Your IDE must support [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/)
* Your maven repository must contain [Oracle jdbc drivers](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html) - or you can simply remove references to it in pom.xml to use [H2 database](http://www.h2database.com) instead.
